                Good day there! My name is Manuel Francisco Venegas.
                I am a certified  self-taught Front-End Developer and a full-time paint Associate at
                Home Depot. I had no intentions of being a paint Associate
                at Home Depot when I first sent my application to them. I was even worried
                that I might not be cut-out to this department, however being able to work with other
                associates helped me tremendously and helped my confidence in this type of work. Being able to collaborate with other Associates was fantastic because
                it also opened my eyes to what great work ethics are like and gave me
                a realization to always give my one-hundred percent in my work in
                order to become a better worker in general.
            </p>

            <p>
                These skills are what I will always carry over to my next career in Front-End Development.
                The thought of collaborating with other talented and well knowledged developers in
                the career I have a passion for excites me! I want to work with other developers to not just socialize
                and network with, but to stregnthen my knowledge in Front-End Development 
                and become an overall better developer in this field of work. 
            </p>
